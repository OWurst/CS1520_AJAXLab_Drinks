# omw3_1520_AJAX_Lab
A simple Flask based application that uses AJAX to randomly present a user with a new drink, its ingredients, and how to make it. The app fetches the information
from an online database that returns a JSON file. To run, configure a virtual environment, install flask, and run drinks.py.
